Phew, quite some time passed since [part 1](http://fixpt.de/blog/2017-12-04-strictness-analysis-part-1.html)!
At the end of the last post, I made a promise to implement a strictness
analysis Ã  la GHC with you, so enjoy!

Since this is a literate Haskell file, we need to get the boring preamble out of the way.

# Syntax

Compared to GHC's Core IR, we will have a simpler, untyped core calculus with
|let| bindings and if/then/else (instead of full-blown case expressions).

> data Expr
>   = Var Name
>   | App Expr Expr
>   | Lam Name Expr
>   | Let Bind Expr
>   | If Expr Expr Expr
>   deriving (Eq, Show)
>
> type Name = String -- We assume names are unique!
>
> data Bind
>   = NonRec (Name, Expr)
>   | Rec [(Name, Expr)]
>
> type Program = [Bind]

Like in GHC, a program is just a list of top-level bindings. Also note that we
allow recursive bindings, which means the analysis will need to do
/fixed-point iteration/ to reach a sound approximation of program semantics.

Next, we'll define the [lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order))
that will carry analysis information. Specifically, we will /denote/ an
expression by its /strictness type/.

By the way, this blog post is so long because I tried to fit everything in one
literate Haskell file. Morally, this post should be split in two (or even three)
parts:
One discussing lattice ingredients and the other discussing how
to actually implement the analysis, just in case you felt
overwhelmed when looking at the scroll bar after scrolling the first time :).
I'll remind you to take a break later on.

# Lattice

For brevity, we will not include strictness on tuple components
(resp. record fields), because that would blow up this blog post too much.
But know that this approach extends straight-forwardly to records.

## Strictness signatures

Without nested strictness on product types, is there even anything useful
to analyse for? Yes, there is! We can still record if a variable was evaluated
at all. There's |const|, for example:

> const :: a -> b -> a
> const a b = a

|const| is strict in its first argument and lazy in its second. That's easy
to see by evaluating |const undefined 5| and |const 5 undefined|.
So, in the language of GHC's demand signatures, we want to summarise |const| by
|<S,_><L,_>| (usage demands elided). GHC will use this strictness signature at
every call site of |const| to approximate the strictness behavior of |const|
without having to repeatedly analyse its right-hand side during analysis.

## Call demands

Fair enough, but what about a function like |twice|?

> twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
> twice f x = f (f x)

Since we don't know anything about what strictness |f| puts on its argument,
we would summarise |twice| by the same signature as |const|.
But we really want a call like |twice (\x -> x + n) m| to be strict in |n|!
Just knowing that we are /head/-strict in the lambda argument doesn't cut it:
Evaluation will stop immediately since it's already in weak-head normal form.
On the other hand, we can't just interpret |S| as 'strict on the return value'
(what does that even mean?) to unleash strictness on |n| within the lambda
body. Since |const| has the same signature, we would also mark |n| strict in
a call like |const (\x -> x + m) 5|, which is incorrect:
|const (\x -> undefined) 5 `seq` 42 == 42|.

There's an unspoken assumption here: Strictness properties of some language
construct are always relative to an incoming /evaluation demand/, which is
head-strictness (the demand |seq| puts on its first argument) unless stated
otherwise. E.g., under the assumption of head-strictness, a call like
|const a b| is head-strict on |a| and lazy in |b|.

Note that |twice| differs from |const| in that it puts the /result/
of applying |f| to one argument under head-strictness. In GHC's strictness
language, this corresponds to a /call demand/ of |C(S)|. This is a strictly
stronger demand than |S|, the demand |const| puts on its first argument.

This has an important effect on our earlier |twice (\x -> x + n) m| example.
Knowing that the lambda expression is put under strictness demand |C(S)|,
it is suddenly possible for the analysis to look inside the lambda
abstraction, paying with the outer call component to discharge the remaining
|S| demand on the lambda body. In this way, the analysis detects that the
whole expression is strict in |n|.

At the same time, analysing |const (\x -> undefined) 5| assuming
head-strictness will only unleash a non-call demand |S| on the lambda,
which is not enough to meaningfully analyse its body under any other
strictness than |L|. This corresponds to our intuition that, relative
to a single evaluation (to head normal form) of our expression, the
lambda body may or may not be evaluated.

## Free variables

You may have noticed that we didn't really define yet what it means for
a variable to be strict in some expression in which it occurs free.

TODO: Where to move this?

Traditionally, a function |f| is strict in (one of) its parameter if
it preserves non-termination, e.g. |f undefined = undefined|.
There's no way for the function to decide if its argument will blow up
when evaluated other than actually evaluating it, so it's equivalent
to say that if |f| is strict, then (either |f = const undefined| or) it
evaluates its argument on every possible execution path.

How can we extend this to our intuitive notion of strictness in a variable
that occurs free in some expression? We can just capture that free
variable with a lambda and apply our original definition. So, when we talk
about the strictness of |n| as it demanded in |twice (\x -> x + n) m|, we
are actually talking about strictness properties of the function
|\n -> twice (\x -> x + n) m|.

Our analysis will track free variables in an extra /environment/, mapping
|Name|s to the strictness demand they are put under.

## Putting everything together

Alright, so now we have everything in place to denote Haskell expressions
in terms of their strictness properties.

As discussed above, expressions, most prominently variables, can be put
under a certain |Strictness|:

> -- | Captures lower bounds on evaluation cardinality of some expression.
> -- E.g.: Is this expression evaluated at least once, and if so, what is the
> -- maximum number of arguments it was surely applied to?
> data Strictness
>   = Lazy        -- ^ Evaluated lazily (possibly not evaluated at all)
>   | Strict Int  -- ^ Evaluated strictly (at least once), called with n args
>   | HyperStrict -- ^ Fully evaluated, a call with maximum arity
>
> instance Show Strictness where
>   show Lazy = "L"
>   show (Strict 0) = "S"
>   show (Strict n) = "C(" ++ show (Strict (n-1)) ++ ")"
>   show HyperStrict = "B"

The |Show| instance tries to adhere to GHC's syntax. You can see how call
demands |C(_)| and regular strictness |S| could be elegantly unified in this
formulation. I sneaked in another constructor, |HyperStrict|. You think of
it as the strongest strictness possible. In our case, that corresponds to a call
with infinite arity.

Earlier, we were informally talking about how |S| is a /stronger/ demand than
|L|. We can capture that meaning by providing an instance of |SemiJoinLattice|,
which consists of defining a /least upper bound/ or /supremum/ operator |\/|:

> instance JoinSemiLattice Strictness where
>  Lazy \/ _ = Lazy
>  _ \/ Lazy = Lazy
>  HyperStrict \/ s = s
>  s \/ HyperStrict = s
>  Strict n \/ Strict m = Strict (min n m)

On a total |Ord| like |Strictness|, this is just a fancy name for |max|.
"Hold on,", I hear you complain, "I thought |HyperStrict| was the greatest element?!
This is all backwards!"

By the way, the syntactic resemblence to boolean or is no accident: In fact, 

instance BoundedJoinSemiLattice Strictness where
  bottom = HyperStrict

instance MeetSemiLattice Strictness where
  HyperStrict /\ _ = HyperStrict
  _ /\ HyperStrict = HyperStrict
  Lazy /\ s = s
  s /\ Lazy = s
  Strict n /\ Strict m = Strict (n /\ m)

instance BoundedMeetSemiLattice Strictness where
top = Lazy
