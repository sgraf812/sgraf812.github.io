# About

Hey, I'm Sebastian Graf, a research software engineer at the [Lean FRO](https://lean-fro.org/team/), where I am working on implementing a verification condition generator for monadic programs written in Lean.
Previously, I was a [research assistant](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/person.php?id=174&lang=en) pursuing a PhD at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology on static analyses of functional language programs.
When I'm not hacking on program language implementations, I'm probably having a great time with my trumpet and fellow musicians in one of the many orchestras I'm part of.

You can contact me on one of the social networks listed in the top and bottom bar.
