# About

Hey, I’m Sebastian Graf, [research assistant](https://pp.ipd.kit.edu/person.php?id=174&lang=en) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
When I’m not learning about the implementation and the semantics of programming languages, I’m probably having a great time with my trumpet and fellow musicians in one of the many orchestras I’m part of.

You can contact me with the form below or find me on one of the social networks listed in the top and bottom bar.
